Start the program in a NES or equivalent. You should get a black screen. Follow the steps below to have each feature demonstrated in a way that makes its operation easily visible so that you can clearly see what it does.

Pattern selection: Press Right a few times. This cycles through the patterns. Press Left to go back the other direction. Keep going through patterns until you reach the clockwise spiral.

Animation speed: Press Down a few times. This slows down animation. Press Up several times. Now things move quickly, even though the light still pulses at the same rate. Note that some patterns aren't affected by this speed.

Shape changes: Hold B and press Left. This selects circles. Try B and other directions. Now, hold B and press Select then Left. Now you get windows. Release B then hold B again and press Left. Now you get circles again.

Color spectrum: Hold Select and press Left twice. This confines it to a portion of the spectrum. Hold Select and press Left once. This confines it to a an even smaller part of the spectrum, barely changing color. Hold Select and press Left three times. This returns to cycling through the entire spectrum.

Color rate: Note how the color is constantly changing. Hold Select and press Down. Now the color changes more slowly, but still cycles through the spectrum. Hold Select and press Down a few more times. This reduces the rate to zero, so that the color isn't changing at all.

Color fine-tune: Hold Select and press Right a few times. Each press slightly adjusts the color. This allows you to get just the color you want.

Color inversion: Hold Select and press A. This inverts the screen while held, so you can easily do it in time with music. Now, Hold Select and A, then while still holding A, release Select. This keeps the screen inverted. Hold Select and press Start to change the background color. Hold Select and press A to turn inverse back off.

Grayscale: Hold Select and press B. This removes color from everything. Hold Select and press B and A. This removes color and inverts everything. As with inversion, it can be kept on by releasing Select while holding B. Hold Select and press A then B to disable grayscale and inversion.

Tempo adjustment: Hold Start and press Up. This increases the tempo. Hold Start and press Down. This decreases it.

Tempo colors: Hold Start and press Left twice. This slightly alters the color each beat. Hold Start and press Left three times. This has it get dark on each beat, rather than bright. Hold Start and press Right twice. This fades in for one beat, then out for the next, etc. Press Left to cycle through patterns until you find the spinning pinwheel. Hold Start and press Right three times. This changes the brightness by one step each beat, which works well for patterns like this one. Try the other tempo modes on this pattern, as they have different effects than on the spiral. Hold Start and press Right once, then Left once to go back to normal flashes each beat. Press Right to go to the expanding circle pattern.

Tempo synchronization with music: Start some music with a clear beat. Hold Start and press B in time with 5 or more beats. Now the tempo is synchronized with the music. Every 15 or so beats, Hold Start and press B in time with 2 to 4 beats to fine-tune the tempo. After it's been fine-tuned for half a minute or so, it should stay well-synchronized. Hold Start and press Up/Down to adjust the tempo manually. Hold Start and press B once to go back to the synchronized tempo. See Tempo Synchronization below for a more complete description of this feature. If used correctly, it stays in time with the music quite well.

Tempo pause: Hold Start and press Select. This pauses all animation. Do that again to unpause.

Random pattern: Hold A and press Select. This selects a random pattern.

Direct pattern selection: Hold A and press Left. This should select the clockwise spiral pattern. Hold A and press Left twice. This should select the falling stars pattern. This allows 8 patterns to be directly selected. By default, Holding A and pressing Down twice switches to an all-black pattern, in case you want to end a sequence smoothly. It can be configured by holding any button while pressing reset.

Pattern memory: Switch to a some pattern. Hold A and B at the same time and press Select, then Left. This remembers the current pattern and settings. Now switch to a different pattern and change various settings. Now hold A and B and press Left. This recalls the pattern you first saved. Four patterns can be remembered at a time. This is useful if come across a combination that looks especially good, and want to quickly go back to it later.
