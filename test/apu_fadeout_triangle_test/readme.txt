APU volume sliders works incorrect.
This error doesn't occur when vol=100%. But if you try to reduce volume, then:
1) On squares/noise slider work like threshhold filter, causing cut-off on low volumes (lower slider volume = stronger cut-off)
2) On triangle slider work like distortion, causing distort triangle timbre.

Here is test ROM i've made for show this bug.
