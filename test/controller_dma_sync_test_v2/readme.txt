Should turn the screen white when pressing RIGHT for 'even'. If screen turns white immediately for 'even', fail. If 'odd' should turn white immediately.

DMC DMA read corruption occurs in Nestopia UE on even cycles when it should occur on odd cycles. I'd like to use even-cycle joypad reads to avoid having to spend cycles reading joypads 2 or more times, as discussed here: https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=14319. This issue can be tested with dma_sync_test; version 1, with separate even-cycle and odd-cycle versions, can be found on the first page of that thread, while v2 (with just even-cycle) is on page 2 and on the Nesdev "Emulator tests" page. The tests display a black screen until a right input is observed, turning the screen white. The v1 even-cycle and v2 tests are expected to not turn white until the user presses right, while the v1 odd-cycle test is expected to show a white screen almost immediately. While other emulators I've tested that emulate this corruption (Mesen 0.9.7, puNES 0.100, Nintendulator 0.975) match expected behavior, Nestopia UE's behavior is inverted, indicating the cycle alignment is wrong. I've tested on versions 1.47 and 1.49.
