This test caught something interesting for me. If the emulator treats IRQs as a single boolean throughout the app and does not differentiate between the DMC irq, the frame counter IRQ, and any mapper IRQs, the scrolling middle section will freeze. This is likely due to erroneous acks of the DMC IRQ when reading the APU status register. To fix it, each IRQ must be tracked and acked separately.
